name: Visual difference detection
# This workflow performs visual comparisons between the main branch and a pull request.
# It activates when the "visual-comparison-required" label is added to a pull request.
#
# KEY POINTS:
# - Activation:         The workflow triggers only when the "visual-comparison-required" label is added.
# - Trigger Conditions: Subsequent commits or amendments to the pull request will not trigger the workflow again.
#                       To re-trigger, remove and re-add the "visual-comparison-required" label.
# - Label Handling:     Other labels can also activate the workflow. However, the workflow will halt if the "visual-comparison-required" label is missing.
# - Caution:            If the "visual-comparison-required" label is present, adding other labels will still trigger and execute the entire workflow.
